Created as a response to Shakespeareâ€™s tragedy, Hamlet, this series of illustrations imagines the throne room of the Danish royal family, not as a blank stage set to be remade after each showing of a play, but as a real place, altered by the events of the story, with natural lighting that reflects the passage of time.
