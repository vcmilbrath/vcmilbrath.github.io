<h2 id="about" >About</h2>

<p>My name is Valarie Milbrath, but all my friends call me Val-Pal. We're probably not friends, so you probably shouldn't call me that. You can just call me Valarie. I am a 21 year old artist and architect currently working out of Chicago, IL. I graduated with my B.A. in Architectural Design and my B.S. Construction Management from the University of Washington in 2021. I currently work as an Integrated Construction Coordinator for INSERT COMPANY NAME.</p>
