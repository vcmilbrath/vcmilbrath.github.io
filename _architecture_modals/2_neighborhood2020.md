In typical years, the neighborhood design build studio rapidly designs a small structure and then builds that project for a local organization.  In 2020, the client organization was the Whidbey Island Tilth, which teaches locals about sustainable small-scale farming techniques, hosts a farmerâ€™s market, and is planning to run a small farm stand.  Our project was to design and build farmstand for them, though because of the pandemic, construction and construction-level design development were put off until the following spring.

The following book, put together by half the class (while others took on additional drawing detailing and graphic clean-up) offers a narrative for our design process over the spring 2020 quarter.
